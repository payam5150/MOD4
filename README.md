<b>Believe it or not, almost all online businesses today make use of recommender systems in some way or another.</b>

Letâ€™s look at the top 3 websites on the Internet: Google, YouTube, and Facebook.

<b>Recommender systems form the very foundation of these technologies.</b>

<b>Google:</b> Search results

They are why Google is the most successful technology company today.

<b>YouTube:</b> Video dashboard

<b>Facebook:</b> So powerful that world governments are worried that the newsfeed has too much influence on people!

<b>Conclusion: Our research show the movies that are highly correlated with "Forrest Gump (1994)". The movies on the list are some of the most famous Hollywood movies and since "Forest Gump (1994)" is also a very famous movie, there is a high chance that these movies are correlated which we recommend to our viewers.</b>
