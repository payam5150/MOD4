<b>Project Statement:</b> As a Data Scientist, I have been tasked with making movie recommendations based on the MovieLens dataset from the GroupLens research lab at the University of Minnesota.

<b>Data Source:</b>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<b>Project Goal: </b> To build a model that provides top 5 movie recommendations to a user, based on their ratings of other movies.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<b>What are Recommendation Systems?</b> A subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item.

<b>Who uses them?</b> Podcasts, social media applications, media streaming services, online shopping, etc.

<b>What are they recommending?</b> Movies, television series, songs, consumer goods, podcast channels, etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<b>Believe it or not, almost all online businesses today make use of recommender systems in some way or another.</b>

Letâ€™s look at the top 3 websites on the Internet: <b>Google, YouTube, and Facebook.</b>


<b>Recommender systems form the very foundation of these technologies.</b>

<b>Google:</b> Search results: They are why Google is the most successful technology company today.

<b>YouTube:</b> Video dashboard

<b>Facebook:</b> So powerful that world governments are worried that the newsfeed has too much influence on people! 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<b>Conclusion:</b> If you are a fan of "Forrest Gump (1994)", we recommend the following movies:

<b>#1.Mr. Holland's Opus
#2.Pocahontas
#3.Grumpier Old Men 
#4.Caddyshack</b>  

The movies on the list are some of the most famous Hollywood movies and since "Forest Gump (1994)" is also a very famous movie, there is a high chance that these movies are correlated which we recommend to our viewers.</b>
