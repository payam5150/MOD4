<b>Project Statement:</b> As a Data Scientist, I have been tasked with making movie recommendations based on the MovieLens dataset from the GroupLens research lab at the University of Minnesota.

<b>Data Source:</b>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<b>Project Goal: </b> To build a model that provides top 5 movie recommendations to a user, based on their ratings of other movies.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<b>What are Recommendation Systems?

Who uses them?</b> Podcasts, social media applications, media streaming services, online shopping, etc.

<b>What are they recommending?</b> Movies, television series, songs, consumer goods, podcast channels, etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<b>Believe it or not, almost all online businesses today make use of recommender systems in some way or another.</b>

Letâ€™s look at the top 3 websites on the Internet: Google, YouTube, and Facebook.

<b>Recommender systems form the very foundation of these technologies.</b>

<b>Google:</b> Search results: They are why Google is the most successful technology company today.

<b>YouTube:</b> Video dashboard

<b>Facebook:</b> So powerful that world governments are worried that the newsfeed has too much influence on people! 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<b>Conclusion: Our research show the movies that are highly correlated with "Forrest Gump (1994)". The movies on the list are some of the most famous Hollywood movies and since "Forest Gump (1994)" is also a very famous movie, there is a high chance that these movies are correlated which we recommend to our viewers.</b>
